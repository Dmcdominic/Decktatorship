    title: Recruit Foreign Workers
    description: Everyone knows you can pay foreigners a lot less for the same tasks,

    title: Start A "Work Program"
    description: What if, we took everyone who didn't have a job and gave them a
      job like farming or mining? And in return for the opprotunity to work for their
      country they worked without pay? Only an enemy of the state would refuse that
      deal and you know what we do to ememies of the state.
